**ARE YOU RAYDEE TO AUGMENT YOUR BORWSING ?** (with userjs, user javascript, 
greasemonkey, **userscripts**, etc.)

**YES ?**

Here are my small **Multi‐browser** user scripts.
Mostly for [musicbrainz.org](//musicbrainz.org).


## HOW TO INSTALL ##

You can install those scripts by clicking the **Raw** button 
when you are seeing the source code page of it.

You can start by installing an installer script that will add direct download/install
buttons/icons in front of each userscripts in github, gitlab and bitbucket file listings:
[INSTALL-USER-SCRIPT](//github.com/jesus2099/konami-command/raw/master/INSTALL-USER-SCRIPT.user.js)

Alternatively, some of my scripts are mirrored at 
[Greasy Fork](//greasyfork.org/users/2206-jesus2099?sort=updated#user-script-list) and 
[OpenUserJS](//openuserjs.org/users/jesus2099/scripts?orderBy=updated&orderDir=desc).

Compatibility:

- [Vivaldi](//vivaldi.com) on Windows + [Violentmonkey](//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) (**my setup**)
- [Firefox](//mozilla.org/firefox) + [Greasemonkey](//addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey) (tested sometimes; many users have this)

As Vivaldi is based on Chrome, I guess other Chrome based browsers should work.
Some users have Safari and told me it works for most scripts (please report a bug if not).
